// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure

// A Disjoint-Set is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.
// It provides operations for the following:
// -- adding new sets
// -- merging sets (by replacing them with their union)
// -- finding a representative member of a set (efficiently determine whether two elements are in the same set or not)

class DisjointSet {
  constructor() {}
}
